# ❤️ UCI Heart Disease Prediction  

This repository contains my **Machine Learning project** for the **NTI Training Program**, focused on predicting heart disease using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.  

The goal is to apply data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and machine learning models to classify patients based on the likelihood of having heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)  
- **Features:** Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope, vessels, thalassemia.  
- **Target:** Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing values handling  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Feature scaling  
   - Splitting into train/test sets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - 📈 Correlation heatmaps  
   - 📊 Distribution plots  
   - 🔎 Insights into key risk factors  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree  
   - Applied **cross-validation**  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
   - Compared performance of multiple models
